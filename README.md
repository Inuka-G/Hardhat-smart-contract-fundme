# FundMe Smart Contract

This is a decentralized fundraising smart contract built on Ethereum using Solidity and Hardhat. The `FundMe` contract allows users to send ETH to the contract, which can then be withdrawn by the owner of the contract.

## Features

- **Funding**: Anyone can fund the contract by sending ETH.
- **Withdrawal**: Only the contract owner can withdraw the total funds raised.
- **Owner Restriction**: Only the contract owner has the permission to withdraw funds, ensuring control over the raised ETH.
- **Gas Optimization**: Optimized for efficient transactions and reduced gas fees.
